University of York LaTeX beamer template

Unofficial LaTeX beamer style for outstanding and professional presentations.

Colours and proportions try to follow as much as possible the [**brand guidelines**](https://www.york.ac.uk/staff/external-relations/brand/templates/)

## Example

The following are images extracted from the compiled example you can find [**here (light theme)**](https://github.com/nitrogl/uoy-beamer/blob/main/examples/uoy-example-light-theme.pdf) or here [**here (dark theme)**](https://github.com/nitrogl/uoy-beamer/blob/main/examples/uoy-example-dark-theme.pdf)

## Usage
The easiest way is that of cloning the repository

    git clone https://github.com/nitrogl/uoy-beamer.git

and modify the .tex sample file (of course, rename it as you need).

If you are not starting a presentation from scratch, however, you can just copy the style file along with its directory `uoy-beamer`

+ uoy-beamer.sty
+ uoy-beamer/

to the base directory of your project.
Remember to include the package just below `\documentclass`, like you can see in the sample .tex file.

    \usepackage{uoy-beamer}

Further customisation is possible through few commands/rules.
